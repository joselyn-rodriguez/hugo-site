      <description>Resources for speech and language-focused cognitive scientists! The following is a list of various resources I&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the years. This is mainly for my own reference, but please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me should any of these links no longer work or if you have additional questions.

      <description>Ok, so what is the Critical Language Scholarship? If you&amp;rsquo;re here and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the U.S. State Dept.&amp;rsquo;s Critical Language Scholarship is - don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. The CLS is a language scholarship that&amp;rsquo;s offered by the U.S. State Department for students (undergraduate or graduate) to study a foreign language in a foreign country where that language is spoken. Since this is a government-funded program, it&amp;rsquo;s not too surprising that the languages offered are &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo; in the diplomatic sense - Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Russian, Azerbaijani, Chinese, etc).</description>
