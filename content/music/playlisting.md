Outside of research, I spend most of my time on music: exploring local venues and bands, getting involved at the University of Maryland's student run radio station, [WMUC 90.5](https://wmuc.umd.edu/), and writing (bad) electronica. 

### WMUC 90.5 College Park
WMUCis the University of Maryland's freeform radio station that has been around since 1979.

- I'm currently hosting my radio show [crying in spanish] on [WMUC-Digital](https://wmuc.umd.edu/) where I explore the rich musical landscape of South America, focusing on indie rock, hardcore, and electronica 
- Album Reviews:
    - Wrote some [album reviews](https://wmuc.umd.edu/ghost-site/aoty-2023/) for the radio's 2023 end of the year list!
