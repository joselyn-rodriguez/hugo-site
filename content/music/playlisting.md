Outside of research, I spend most of my time on music: exploring local venues and bands, getting involved at the University of Maryland's student run radio station,[WMUC 90.5](https://wmuc.umd.edu/), and writing (bad) electronica. 

### some things I've done
Wrote some [album reviews](https://wmuc.umd.edu/ghost-site/aoty-2023/) for the radio's end of the year list!
