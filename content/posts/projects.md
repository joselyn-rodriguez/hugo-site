# Web Dev Projects

In addition to my work as an academic, I have an interest in web programming and design. In my free time (re: not writing) I help my friends design and code their websites and work with my brother, [Fernando Rodriguez]("https://github.com/Fernando-Rodriguez"), on what we term "web stuff". 

Here are some of my recent web projects.


## playback 

The Rodriguez-Co (Fernando and My) most recent project is called "playback" and can be thought of as a spotify listening manager.

My role in this project was designing the entire site using Figma for wireframing and such and then programming the front end based on this design using React.

There's a lot more in store for this project though and as we have time, we'll slowly add on more functionality. Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!

The github for the frontend: https://github.com/Rodriguez-Co/better-listening

and backend: https://github.com/Rodriguez-Co/better-listening-auth-api

Big thanks to Fern for always agreeing to work on my crazy ideas:)


## jingyichen.org

My dear cohort-mate wanted a website, and being a good friend, advised her against paying for a static site builder and instead showed her how to buy her domain name and launch a site using hugo (which totals a whole 1$/month for the domain). However, in the face of ugly templates, I ended up throwing a hugo template together for her (and you if you want) to use.
