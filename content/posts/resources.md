### Resources for speech and language-focused cognitive scientists!
The following is a list of various resources I've collected over the years. This is mainly for my own reference, but please don't hesitate to contact me should any of these links no longer work or if you have additional questions.

#### Statistics

* Hadley Wickham's "[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)", a course in R and the tidyverse, is a definite must as a quick (not necessarily painless) introduction to statistics with R.
* While you're at it, take a look at all the other resources they list in R for Data Science: [advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), [Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach](http://mosaic-web.org/go/SM2-technique/), [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), [classic Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, and [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson
* A good book on [Quantitative Methods for Linguistics](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/book/index.html) by Morgan Sonderegger, Michael Wagner, and Francisco Torreira


#### Praat
As we are all aware, using Praat can be a pain, so here are a few collections of useful scripts I've found

* some [links](http://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/facilities/acoustic/praat.html) from the phonetics lab at UCLA
* this [excellent tutorial](http://joeystanley.com/blog/a-tutorial-on-extracting-formants-in-praat) on extracting formants with a praatscript by Joey Stanley
* and another [collection of handy scripts](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~cdicanio/scripts.html) from Christian DiCanio
* and [another](http://www.praatvocaltoolkit.com/index.html) for more specific voice processing needs
* a super helpful [collection of scripts](https://github.com/michellecohn/praat-scripts) from Dr. Michelle Cohn

#### Tandem Straight
Tandem Straight is a speech modification tool that is a re-engineering of the original STRAIGHT by Dr. Hideki Kawahara. It's fairly handy if you need to synthesize some stimuli. It's beneficial in that it is able to morph along several different dimensions and maintains a fairly natural quality.

* currently the [best guide](https://memcauliffe.com/straight_workshop/) I’ve seen, by Michael McAuliffe
* or if you’re interested in doing multiple talker morphing - check out my quick [tutorial](https://github.com/joselyn-rodriguez/TandemStraight/blob/master/3morph_tutorial.md)
* or head straight to the source, Dr. Hideki Kawahara’s [homepage](http://web.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~kawahara/index-e.html)

#### Lab.js
[Lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) is a useful program for making online studies created by [Dr. Felix Henninger](http://felixhenninger.com/). It's usefulness comes in it's fairly easy-to-use, intuitive online graphical interface builder (no-code required. well, not really) at [lab.js.org](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/) as well as it's downloadable lab.js package which allows for building studies from scratch in javascript if that's what you prefer.

* you can find the documents for the builder [here](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/index.html)
* and for the javascript library documentation [here](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html) or go straight to the source on their [github](https://github.com/felixhenninger/lab.js)
* although if you have any specific questions, their [slack channel](https://slackin-nmbrcrnchrs.herokuapp.com/) is the best place to go where you can usually find your answer, or get a quick response

#### Psychopy
Psychopy or Psychojs are both additional software to create studies from scratch in either javascript (for online studies) or python (for in-lab studies) or through their graphical interface. Psychojs currently has the fastest timing on online studies out of a collection of surveyed online experimental software. So if timing is something really important in your study, psychojs might be the best option.

* You can head to their [main page](https://www.psychopy.org/) to learn more about it!

Psychopy is nice to use because it's fairly intuitive and has a really easy to use graphical interface that you can download onto your computer. The interface makes it super easy to make studies from scratch that you plan to run in-lab.

* or if you want to run your study online: [psychojs](https://github.com/psychopy/psychojs) is another good option

You can build your studies as you would normally in your psychopy builder and then export the html to an online repository ([pavlovia](https://www.pavlovia.org/)) so you can run your studies **online**. Keep in mind that pavlovia charges to host your studies - not very much money, but charges nonetheless.

* you can find the documentation for psychojs [here](https://psychopy.github.io/psychojs/)


**for information about timing in Psychopy and Lab.js (and other experiment software) check out this [paper](http://psyarxiv.com/d6nu5/)**

#### Mechanical Turk
Mechanical Turk is an online crowdsourcing platform created by Amazon. Many researchers use this to run their experiments online quickly and easily. Depending on how much control you want to have over your studies, this can either be an easy or quite difficult option for running your studies online.

* start [here](https://www.mturk.com/)
* dig through the [api](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/Welcome.html)


#### Scholarships/Fellowships/Grants you should know about  

 *Language scholarships*

* [Critical Language Scholarship](https://www.clscholarship.org/)

* [Foreign language and area studies fellowship](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/iegpsflasf/index.html)

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions about either of these ones. I received both of them and have my old essays around somewhere.

 *Graduate Fellowships*

 Here is some [general advice](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/new_publication_3/%7B7A9CB4F4-815F-DE11-BD80-001CC477EC70%7D.pdf) about writing grants (at any stage in your career) for social science researchers

* [Ford Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/index.htm)

Some helpful information on both the Ford and GRFP can be found at [Carl Fields' website](https://carlnotsagan.github.io/resources/)

* [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program  (GRFP)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201)

And a list of GRFP example essays and information can be found at [Alex Lang's website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship)

And even more info can be found at Dr. Mallory Ladd's [personal website](http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html)


*Post-doc and Career Fellowships/Grants/Programs*

* [Emmy Noether Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/)

This is an interesting one if you're interested in working in Germany. This program is for early-career researchers and provides funding for up to 4 years to work as a project lead at a German institution with the assumption that foreigners who participate will stay in Germany following completion of the program. This early career program can be followed by the Heisenberg program.

* [Heisenberg Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/heisenberg/index.html)

This is a program directed primarily at those researchers who have qualified for professorship via the Emmy Noether Programme. So if that's a path you want to go down, these two would be good to look into.

* [Riken Hakubi Fellowship](https://www.riken.jp/en/careers/programs/hakubi/index.html)

The Hakubi Fellows Program, RIKEN offers junior PI positions for independent research by exceptionally talented individuals. The program, established in 2017, encourages active exchange between the fellows, and seeks to develop the next generation of leading researchers with a global outlook. This would be a good position if you'd like international experience at a research center in Japan.

* [Sechi Kato Program for RIKEN Hakubi Fellows](https://www.riken.jp/en/careers/programs/kato_sechi/index.html)

Similar to the program above, this is just for women.


*Other Grants (misc)*

* [Grammy Museum research/preservation grant](https://grammymuseum.org/national-reach/grant-program/)
