  Hi! I'm a third year PhD student in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science at the University of Maryland. 
  I'm housed in the Department of Linguistics and am advised by [Dr. Naomi Feldman](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/) and [Dr. Bill Idsardi](https://wjidsardi.net/). 

  Prior to coming to UMD, I worked as a lab assistant and graduate student with [Dr. Dave Kleinschmidt](http://davekleinschmidt.com) in the Department of Psychology at Rutgers University.

  My research focuses on computational modeling of speech perception and learning (and occasionally behavioral and neuroimaging experiments). The questions that interest me most are those surrounding second language acquisition.
  How do we learn a second language? How is this process different than how we learn our first language?
  
  I'm joined at UMD by the other members of my linguistics cohort, [Katherine Howitt](https://www.katherinehowitt.com/research), Jingyi Chen, [London Dixon](https://www.londondixon.com/) , FÃ«dor Golosov, Zulfiyya Aghakishiyeva.
